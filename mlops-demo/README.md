# MLOps Demo: Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps workflow for a sentiment analysis model using DistilBERT, deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## Project Structure

- **1-model**: Model development, training, and evaluation
- **2-cloud-run-deployment**: Deployment configuration for Google Cloud Run
- **3-pipeline**: MLOps pipeline implementation
- **4-responsible-ai**: Responsible AI practices including fairness and explainability
- **5-monitoring**: Model monitoring and observability
- **6-cicd**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

## Overview

This project showcases how to build and deploy a production-ready ML system following MLOps best practices. The sentiment analysis model uses DistilBERT, a lighter and faster version of BERT that maintains comparable performance.

The complete workflow includes:
- Model development and training
- Cloud deployment with Google Cloud Run
- Automated ML pipelines
- Responsible AI implementation
- Model monitoring and alerting
- CI/CD for ML systems

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt in each directory)
